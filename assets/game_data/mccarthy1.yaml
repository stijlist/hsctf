  Our operative, codenamed MCCARTHY, has been busy infiltrating Hacker
  Schmool's web services. He has discovered some kind of "secret
  sharing" application used by Hacker Schmool facilitators to talk
  trash about their students. He's managed to steal the source code
  which you can find [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hsctf/mccarthy1/index.php).

  MCCARTHY has also located where the application is running. You
  can find it at http://ctf.hackerschool.com:%{port}.
