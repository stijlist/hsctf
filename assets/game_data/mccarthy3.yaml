  MCCARTHY found that Hacker Schmool completely ripped off Hacker
  School's site. This is unacceptable!

  You can find their flagrant plagarism at
  http://ctf.hackerschool.com:8080. Your job is to deface it. As your
  solution, submit a link that replaces the element with the "logo" id
  with the words "Hacker School!".
