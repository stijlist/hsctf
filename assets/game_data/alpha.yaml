  Hello %{name},

  Congradulations on your new role as Hacker School Brand Defender.
  We're very excited to have you on the team! As the newest member of
  the Intellectual Property Protection Team, your role will be to
  idenfity and liquidate any instances of brand dilution you come across.

  You can communicate with us, your superiors, through Zulip. Send a
  message to me, `@HSCTF` with one of the following commands:

  You can
  1. `help` - see a help screen
  2. `score` - view your score
  3. `solve <LEVEL NAME> <PASSWORD>`

  You advance levels by finding a password. Each level has a
  name. This level is called **alpha**. To continue on your quest, you
  need to find the password for this level. I've encrypted the
  password with a super-secure-cipher. The encrypted password is
  `ariretenqhngr!` Can you find the plaintext?

  Never Graduate,
  Hacker School Brand Protection Bot
