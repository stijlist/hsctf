  MCCARTHY has found the source code of another Hacker Schmool app, a
  guestbook appplication. He has and uploaded it
  [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hsctf/mccarthy2/server.rb).

  MCCARTHY has also located where the application is running. You can
  find it at https://ctf.hackerschool.com:%{port}.

  We also think it's strange that the only app that Hacker Schmool runs over https is a guestbook...
