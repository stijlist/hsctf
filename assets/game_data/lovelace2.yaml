  Good job! 

  LOVELACE has planted another bug for us, and we have some new
  traffic for you to analyze
  [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hsctf/lovelace2/lovelace2.pcap). We
  know that Hacker Schmool has received an important email recently,
  and we'd like to see its contents.

  It is paramount that we don't compromise LOVELACE's cover, so if you
  find yourself logging into a Hacker Schmool account, please don't
  leave any trace of you activity. Especially don't change
  settings/passwords!
