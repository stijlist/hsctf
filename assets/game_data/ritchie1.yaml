  Our operative, codenamed RITCHE, has managed to retrieve the source
  code and executable for Hacker Schmool's doorbot. You can find the
  code [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hsctf/ritchie1/doorbot.c) and the binary
  [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hsctf/ritchie1/doorbot).

  RITCHIE has managed to reroute Hacker Schmool's firewall in order to
  expose doorbot to the outside world. You can reach it at
  ctf.hackerschool.com:%{port}.

  Please retrieve Hacker Schmool's doorbot password.
