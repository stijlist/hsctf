  One of our field operatives, codenamed LOVELACE, has managed to
  plant a bug on a Hacker Schmool router. She's managed to exfiltrate
  some network traffic from Hacker Schmool, but we need your help
  analyzing it.

  We're looking for the password to Hacker Schmool's main FTP
  server. You can find the files our operative has updaloaded here:
