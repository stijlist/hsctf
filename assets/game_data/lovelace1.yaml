  One of our field operatives, codenamed LOVELACE, has managed to
  plant a bug on a Hacker Schmool router. She has exfiltrated
  some network traffic from Hacker Schmool, but we need your help
  analyzing it.

  You can find the PCAP file LOVELACE found
  [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hsctf/lovelace1/lovecraft1.pcap).
  You'll need to get Wireshark to open it. We are looking for some
  kind of password.
