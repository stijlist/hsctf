docker image per challenge 
scorecard app manages spawning new containers?
orrrr... run everything at the same time
when a user hits level x, spawn the container for level x
?? 
max: scoreboard app
kyle: xss
bert: write a progression tree
bot -> send people messages, build interface (score, accepts answers, advances the user)
scoreboard app -> talks to docker manager, tells docker manager to spawn instances, keeps track of registered users, score, game tree
docker manager (phb) -> give it a problem, and it can spawn or destroy the docker instance for that problem
